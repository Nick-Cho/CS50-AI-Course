# Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe minimax AI optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning.  
Built on top of a CS50 template for the Tic-Tac-Toe game found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/.  
<Runner.py> contains the neccesary code for the game logic behind the Tic-Tac-Toe game itself, while <tictactoe.py> contains the neccesary code for the Minimax Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
